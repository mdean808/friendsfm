# FriendsFM

This is the main repository for FriendsFM. It contains the Capacitor.js code for the android and ios apps, as well as the Firebase Functions.

FriendsFM is like the BeReal for music -- each day a notification goes out to you and your friends, prompting you to share what you're listening to!
